        "question": "How does a session proceed?",
        "answer": "After setting up the equipment, we'll discuss your expectations and needs together, as well as any injuries or medical conditions you may have. You'll lie down on the table in your underwear and the session can begin. Depending on the duration chosen and the area to be massaged, you'll lie on your back or stomach. You'll be notified a few minutes before the end of the session that the massage is coming to a close."

      {
        "id": "Two",
        "question": "How can I make the most of my session?",
        "answer": "Be well-rested, preferably on a light stomach, with no alcohol or drugs before the massage. Ensure the room where the session takes place is quiet, and turn off your mobile phone. For optimal effectiveness, it is recommended to relax without falling asleep."

      {
        "id": "Seven",
        "question": "Can you tailor a massage to relieve pain or focus on a specific area?",
